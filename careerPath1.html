    <p>Ever since I was little, I had always dreamt of having a job that not only makes me happy but helps others. As years went by, I started focusing on what particular field of medicine I want to do, and then it came to me; I want to be a doctor more specifically to help children. I always enjoy being around kids. I feel like I have a different type of bond with them; their adorable little faces fill me up with joy. When kids are suffering, it's the most painful thing to watch, and then I decided I want to help them through medicine and would do everything in my ability to make them feel better. </p>
